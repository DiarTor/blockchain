# BlockChain

A simple blockchain implementation written in Python with a Flask-based API.

## Description

This project is a basic blockchain written in Python, utilizing Flask to provide a RESTful API. It allows users to make
transactions and interact with the blockchain via API requests.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/DiarTor/blockchain.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd blockchain
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the API, execute the following command from the `app` directory:

```sh
python app/api.py
```

Once the server is running, you can make requests to the API to interact with the blockchain.
